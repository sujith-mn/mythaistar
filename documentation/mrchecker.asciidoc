= MrChecker E2E Testing

== Introduction
MrChecker is a testing framework included in devonfw with several useful modules, from which we will focus on the Selenium Module, a module designed to make end-to-end testing easier to implement.

== How to use it

First of all download the repository.

You must run My Thai Star frontend and backend application and modify your url to the front in `mrchecker/endtoend-test/src/resources/settings.properties`

Now you can run end to end test to *check* if the application works properly.

To run the e2e test you have two options:

*The first option is using the command line in devonfw distribution*
```
cd mrchecker/endtoend-test/
mvn test -Dtest=MyThaiStarTest -Dbrowser=Chrome

```
optionally you can use it with a headless version or using another navigator:
```
// chrome headless (without visual component)
mvn test -Dtest=MyThaiStarTest -Dbrowser=ChromeHeadless
// use firefox navigator
mvn test -Dtest=MyThaiStarTest -Dbrowser=FireFox
```

*The second is importing the project in devonfw Eclipse and running _MyThaiStarTest.java_ as JUnit (right click, run as JUnit)* 

They can be executed one by one or all in one go, comment or uncomment _@Test_ before those tests to enable or disable them.

For more information about how to use MrChecker and build your own end to end test read:
 * MrChecker documentation
 * MrChecker tutorial for My Thai Star



== End to end tests in My Thai Star

We have included a test suite with four tests to run in My Thai Star to verify everything works properly.

The included tests do the following:

* _Test_loginAndLogOut_: Log in and log out.

* _Test_loginFake_: Attempt to log in with a fake user.

* _Test_bookTable_: Log in and book a table, then login with a waiter and check if the table was successfully booked.

* _Test_orderMenu_: Log in and order food for a certain booked table.

These four tests can be found inside *MyThaiStarTest.java* located link:https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/tree/develop/mrchecker/endtoend-test/src/test/java/com/devonfw/mts/tests[here].
